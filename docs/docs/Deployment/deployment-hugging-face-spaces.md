HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Kozmoai in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Kozmoai in the cloud without any local installation required. Here's how you can get Kozmoai up and running on HuggingFace Spaces:


1. **Access Kozmoai Space**: Open a Chromium-based browser and navigate to the [Kozmoai Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/digitranslab/kozmoai?duplicate=true). This link directs you to a pre-configured environment for Kozmoai.


2. **Duplicate the Space**: You'll encounter an option to duplicate the Kozmoai space. This step involves a few simple decisions:

	- **Naming Your Space**: Assign a unique name to your new Space.
	- **Visibility Settings**: Choose between Public or Private visibility for your Space.
	- After setting these parameters, click on **Duplicate Space** to initiate the setup.

4. **Start Exploring Kozmoai**: With the setup complete, Kozmoai is now ready for use in your Space and you can start exploring its features and capabilities right away!
